# ðŸ§¬ AI Evolution Simulation

A visual predatorâ€“prey simulation built in Python using neural networks and genetic algorithms. Inspired by *Spore*, this project explores emergent behavior in artificial lifeforms through evolution, survival pressure, and energy-based interaction.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Creatures evolve using simple neural networks
- Predators also evolve and must feed to survive
- Realistic energy mechanics and feeding cooldowns
- Mutation and selection drive generational improvement
- Visual simulation using Pygame
- Time control: speed up, slow down, or skip generations
- Stat overlay showing generation, energy, kills, and survivors
